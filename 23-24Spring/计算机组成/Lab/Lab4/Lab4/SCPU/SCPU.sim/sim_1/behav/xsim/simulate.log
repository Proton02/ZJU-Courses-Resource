Block Memory Generator module Testbench_tb.m0.U1.inst.\native_mem_module.blk_mem_gen_v8_4_7_inst  is using a behavioral model for simulation which will not precisely model memory collision behavior.
WARNING: This core is supplied with a behavioral model. To model cycle-accurate behavior you must run timing simulation.
